# Primitives

Variables
- Come in types
- Type --> Classification of data that provides the possible encodings for information to be represented
- I.e. The possible values for that type, and the operations that are allowed to be performed on it

### Bit shifting

```
x >> num - right shift (shift x by num bits to the right)
x << num  - left shift (shift x by num bits to the left)
x & y - bit-wise AND
x | y - bit-wise OR
x ^ y - bit-wise XOR
```
